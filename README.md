# ToDoList Example Application

> This example will show how to use TypoScript 2.0 in a context outside of Neos.

## How to install

1. Clone this repository and run `composer install`.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NeosMeetupHH/ToDoListBaseDistribution
  cd ToDoListBaseDistribution
  composer install
  ```
2. If you're using apache, create a virtualhost with a document root pointing to the /Web directory that was created during composer installation. Use the corresponding mechanisms for other web servers if needed.
3. Create a (MySQL) database for the application.

  ```SQL
  CREATE DATABASE todolist COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
  ```

4. Configure Flow to use the database, therefore create the file Configuration/Development/Settings.yaml:

  ```yaml
  TYPO3:
    Flow:
      persistence:
        backendOptions:
          dbname: 'todolist'   # your database name
          user: ''             # your database user
          password: ''         # your database password
  ```

5. Run all doctrine migrations to install the basic database structure:

  ```bash
  ./flow doctrine:migrate
  ```

6. Run the fixture installation command, to make sure there's initial data in your database:

  ```bash
  ./flow todolist:fixtures
  ```

Now, the application should be ready to run.

## Credits

This demo application is powered by [Flow](https://github.com/neos/flow).

The frontend part was done with [reduct](https://github.com/reduct) and [Brics](https://github.com/Inkdpixels/Brics).

Have a look at all three of them, these are powerful companions ;)
